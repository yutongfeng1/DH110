## :white_check_mark: Step 1: Specify the main design challenge

#### What is the main activity your project would support for the users?
This project will support users in finding and applying for government benefit programs that fit their needs.

#### What is the basic need/goal involved for that activity? (reference)
This activity fulfills the user's physiological and safety needs as financial support is vitable for the well being and living of many in this country. It may also fulfill the user's esteem needs when the financial, medical, or nutritional support allows them to feel less lacking and more satisfied in everyday living. 

#### What is(are) the traditional/current solution(s) to satisfy the needs?
The traditional solution would be to go to the government office to read or consult about different benefit programs and eligibility. Usually to head back again with all necessary paperwork to begin the application there. All next steps in this application process would require running to the government office. This would also mean that managing and checking these benefits would require an in-person interaction at the office.

In terms of the current solution, users can read about state-wide benefit programs on the government website, such as [The Arizona Department of Economic Security](https://des.az.gov/), to be learn about the various financial benefits that exist. Eligibility and next steps are also stated for each specific program. Users will be redirected to another website, such as the [Health-e-Arizona portal](https://www.healthearizonaplus.gov/Login/Default) to begin their application or manage their benefits if already registered. 

#### What is(are) the limitation(s) that possibly would be improved with (digital) technology?
Limitations in the in-person solution arise due to COVID-19 and the fact that it takes several commutes to begin the application; it is a tiresome process to finally get to the help that many residents may immediately need. The current solution is no better; State government websites overwhelm users with information without giving short overviews of all the benefit programs offered, clear steps to action, or easy access to screening tools. Users are left often confused, frustrated, and skeptical to the low legitimacy and efficiency of these government websites. 

## :white_check_mark: Step 2: Target Users

#### What are the characteristics of users? (ex. demographics, preference, expertise, mainstream vs. extreme) 
I will focus on new-grad individuals who are looking for additional financial support post graduation. As they may move out of their families or college shared-homes, rent and other additional living fees are a burden to their usually low-to-medium range income as they are starting out in beginner work positions. They would be interested in understanding how they could utilize government support programs and receive such help in terms of financial, medical, or nutritional benefits. 
 * Demographics: new-grad (undergraduate, grad school, or PhD students). 
 * Age: 21-30. Live alone or with roommates in big urban cities with high living costs. 
 * Occupation: Beginner level work position. New to the job market.
 * Tech Savvy. Frequently use laptop or smartphone to browse information online.
 * Looking for additional financial support or benefits. To a certain extend, the availability and accessbility of financial benefits may inform their decisions to move around the country for work and a living.
 * Expertise: users should not need any particular level of expertise

#### In which context (where, why) would the users do that activity? 
Ideally, our target users would engage in research at home with a personal laptop, at their school financial support offices while consulting with a professional, and/or in the public library with a public computer.

#### What do/did the users usually do in order to complete that activity? 
The goal of the users would be to find out what financial benefit programs they are eligible for and, if so, how they can apply for them.
 * Search for existing financial support programs in the given state
 * Read and learn about each program
 * Identify eligibility and next steps
 * Understand broad idea of the application process and timeline: what are the steps, essential documents needed, interviews or phone-calls, how long does it take to process, etc.

## :white_check_mark: Step 3: Pick Research Methods
#### Methods
I decided to use a combination of participatory observation and interview.
 * For participatory observation, I observed 2 activities: **searching** for existing benefit programs and **evaluating** a program to apply for. 
   * Searching for financial support programs online: how would the user find out about the existing financial benefit programs? How would the user digest the information about each available benefit?
   * Evaluating a program to apply for: how would the user evaluate the programs and decide on which one best matches their needs? How would the user find out their next steps? How would the user begin the application?

 * For the interview, I prepared questions that asked the user about their habits in browsing, searching, acessing, and understanding government information or benefit programs online. Some questions also targeted their general attitude and experience with government websites, filing government applications, as well as reading and digesting huge chunks of information.

The user was recruited as she was fitting to the target user demographic and had some previous experience working with government websites (i.e., in terms of working with taxes and visa). Since these two activities are and can be located in an online context (considering the current solution of accessing official government informative websites), this was conducted in the user’s own home through an online video call. I used Zoom to record the tasks the user has performed and a laptop camera to record the user’s facial expressions. I also made pen-and-paper of interesting points the participant made during the interview.

### Interesting insights from the interview:
#### 1️⃣ In terms of her general experience and attitude towards government websites, the user perceives a strong correlation between aesthetically pleasing UI and security/legitimacy (10:42)
 > Usually the layout is pretty outdated, ugly looking, and at the same time interaction isn't super clear. It is not pretty and I don't like interacting with it - it only does the bare minimum. I don't feel very secure either, feels like it's going to get hacked. I am usually not comfortable with sharing my personal information. Though I know it has nothing to do with how pretty it is and how safe it is, somehow in my mind I just make that correlation. It also makes me feel like I'm not very important, and sometimes I feel like they don't work at all. 

#### 2️⃣ User feels extremely overwhelmed not only by the amount of information available, but also the fact that some information are only made available to the user in later steps (18:25)
 > (After jumping to the [Arizona Self Help Website](arizonaselfhelp.org) from [The Arizona Department of Economic Security Website](https://des.az.gov/), the user finds herself frustrated with the lack of organization in this information finding process). This doesn't look legit at all. Actually, I feel bad for people doing research about this. Ok, look like I need to bring stuff for an eligibility interview. Like, ok, didn't know that existed. I would love to have something to say what is the progress, because currently I just feel like things are getting thrown at me. 

#### 3️⃣ User loves the screening tool but wish it was included in the main page as an easy transparent filter (28:44)
 > There's something with making these filters more transparent. Like, at least something I can read immediate on this website about my eligibility for all the benefit programs. Maybe a table to list all benefit programs and eligiblity, for example, what is the income range that is eligible for each program. That would be super helpful so I don't have to go through the screening process and already know what I want. I can just go ahead and click on the application page and select the program. 

#### 4️⃣ User is dissatisfied with the time she spent on these two tasks, feeling like all was too inefficient and redundant (30:32)
 > I would have liked to spend less time to learn about these information in a more concise manner. I would like to have an overview of the steps, and very transparently know whether I am eligiblity for certain programs or not on just one website. I feel like there were a lot of jumping around, and don't really like that fact that all the websites were scattered around. It is really redundant in what each website is trying to do. 

## :white_check_mark: Step 6: Reflection
Though coming up with the contextual inquiry script was difficult as it was hard to think of generic yet targeted questions about the user's context, I enjoyed how we had more freedom to discuss feelings and ideas during the activity compared to the more serious or formal Usability Testing. The fact that the user will not fail or succeed in a task on certain preset metrics made the session more relaxing for me to prompt questions, get to understand what they like, and stop them in the middle of tasks to more finely ask about what they just said. It was nice to see how the user would navigate the task without any direction in their own way and in an environment that is most natural. The usability testing felt forced and there was always an element where the user wanted to succeed in the task to please the moderator. I am glad that I chose to take on a more passive role during the observation activities as I just watched the user freely explore the websites while expressing her thoughts. I always thougth that asking the right questions was the only way to gain insights on the user's experience, however after this research sessions I realized that by just simply observing the user in their "natural habitat" without any biased intervention, insights, left unpolluted by our previous assumptions or subjective experience, can be brought to light. 

Moving forward, I want to improve my skill in probing non-leading questions on the spot. I think it is also important that I don't ask as many background questions as I did at the beginning, but to ask questions about their habits, attitudes, and preferences during the participant observation stage. This way, these questions are located more closely within the context and are much more focused and directly in relation with my research interests. At the end of the session, I also felt like the user and I were constantly repeating ourselves. In future user research sessions, it will be essential for me to learn how to control the pace and time of the session - if enough insights have been produced and discussions about key points have been very thorough, I don't have to go through all the questions in the script one-by-one but pick out the ones left completely unanswered. 

Overall, I really enjoyed this user research session. I can't wait to participate in studies like these to learn more about the ways professional user researchers conduct their sessions.
