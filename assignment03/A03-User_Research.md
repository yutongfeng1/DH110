## :white_check_mark: Step 1: Specify the main design challenge

#### What is the main activity your project would support for the users?
This project will support users in finding and applying for government benefit programs that fit their needs.

#### What is the basic need/goal involved for that activity? (reference)
This activity fulfills the user's physiological and safety needs as financial support is vitable for the well being and living of many in this country. It may also fulfill the user's esteem needs when the financial, medical, or nutritional support allows them to feel less lacking and more satisfied in everyday living. 

#### What is(are) the traditional/current solution(s) to satisfy the needs?
The traditional solution would be to go to the government office to read or consult about different benefit programs and eligibility. Usually to head back again with all necessary paperwork to begin the application there. All next steps in this application process would require running to the government office. This would also mean that managing and checking these benefits would require an in-person interaction at the office.

In terms of the current solution, users can read about state-wide benefit programs on the government website, such as [The Arizona Department of Economic Security](https://des.az.gov/), to be learn about the various financial benefits that exist. Eligibility and next steps are also stated for each specific program. Users will be redirected to another website, such as the [Health-e-Arizona portal](https://www.healthearizonaplus.gov/Login/Default) to begin their application or manage their benefits if already registered. 

#### What is(are) the limitation(s) that possibly would be improved with (digital) technology?
Limitations in the in-person solution arise due to COVID-19 and the fact that it takes several commutes to begin the application; it is a tiresome process to finally get to the help that many residents may immediately need. The current solution is no better; State government websites overwhelm users with information without giving short overviews of all the benefit programs offered, clear steps to action, or easy access to screening tools. Users are left often confused, frustrated, and skeptical to the low legitimacy and efficiency of these government websites.

#### What are the characteristics of users? (ex. demographics, preference, expertise, mainstream vs. extreme) 
I will focus on new-grad individuals who are looking for additional financial support post graduation. As they may move out of their families or college shared-homes, rent and other additional living fees are a burden to their usually low-to-medium range income as they are starting out in beginner work positions. They would be interested in understanding how they could utilize government support programs and receive such help in terms of financial, medical, or nutritional benefits. 
 * Demographics: New-Grad (undergraduate, grad school, or PhD students). Age: 21-30. Occupation: New-Grad, Beginner level work position. New to the job market, live alone or with roommates in big urban cities with high living costs. 
 * Frequently use laptop or smartphone to browse information online. Tech Savvy. 
 * Looking for additional financial support or benefits. To certain extents, availability and accessbility of great financial benefits may inform their decisions to move around the country for work and a living.
 * Expertise: users should not need any particular level of expertise

#### In which context (where, why) would the users do that activity? 
Ideally, our target users would engage in research at home with a personal laptop, at their school financial support offices while consulting with a professional, and/or in the public library with a public computer.

#### What do/did the users usually do in order to complete that activity? 
The goal of the users would be to find out what financial benefit programs they are eligible for and, if so, how they can apply for them.
 * Search for existing financial support programs in the given state
 * Read and learn about each program
 * Identify eligibility and next steps
 * Understand broad idea of the application process and timeline: what are the steps, essential documents needed, interviews or phone-calls, how long does it take to process, etc.

## :white_check_mark: Step 3: Pick Research Methods
#### Methods
I decided to use a combination of participatory observation and interview.
For participatory observation, I observed 2 activities: **searching** for existing benefit programs and **evaluating** a program to apply for. 
 * Searching for financial support programs online: how would the user find out about the existing financial benefit programs? How would the user digest the information about each available benefit?
 * Evaluating a program to apply for: how would the user evaluate the programs and decide on which one best matches their needs? How would the user find out their next steps? How would the user begin the application?

The user was recruited as she was fitting to the target user demographic and had some previous experience working with government websites (i.e., in terms of working with taxes and visa). Since these two activities are and can be located in an online context (considering the current solution of accessing official government informative websites), this was conducted in the user’s own home through an online video call. I used Zoom to record the tasks the user has performed and a laptop camera to record the user’s facial expressions. I also made pen-and-paper of interesting points the participant made during the interview.

For the interview, I prepared questions that asked the user about their habits in browsing, searching, acessing, and understanding government information or benefit programs online. Some questions also targeted their general attitude and experience with government websites, filing government applications, as well as reading and digesting huge chunks of information.
