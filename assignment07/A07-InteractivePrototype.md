# Assignment 07: Interactive Prototype

## Project Description
In hopes to improve the Health-e-Arizona-plus Portal that allows Arizona residents to apply and manage their benefits, I designed this interactive prototype to solve the current usability problems and match with user insights. This is the high-fidelity interaction design of the website where users are able to add eligibility filters to select programs based on their eligbility, compare and contrast programs at a glance, and bookmark programs to be viewed later. Users will be able to select the information they are most interested in through a time-efficient manner without having to jump between website and portals. The current prototype will focus on these three actions that are all located on the main landing page/dashboard of the website. 

### Purpose

The purpose of this high-fidelity interactive prototype is to not only test the inituitiveness of the interaction, but to also test if improved graphics and UI components help support a better user experience and facilitate the user's understanding of the taskflow. Will the graphical interface design distract the user or aid the user through their tasks? Are the interactions supported by this prototype inituitive, accessible, and findable to the user?

### Process

After creating the basis of the interface designs, I created the high-fidelity wireflows with the Figma Autoflow plug-in for the two main tasks: eligibility filter and compare programs filter. After having the wireflow for these two tasks layered out, I went ahead and created the interactive prototype via Figma prototyping. I linked all the frames together and tested the prototype a few times on my own. When I found a certain problem in the interactions or a certain dead-end, I went back and edited/added interactions needed to make sure the user would not get lost in the flow. After this self-evaluation stage, I went on to conduct a cognitive walkthrough with my power user (participant from usability testing). After documenting the feedback I received from the user, I added necessary differentiations and duplicated/added screens when necessary to create more of a thorough and clear interaction. 

## List of Tasks Supported
The key tasks, validated by user research and extensive journey mapping of personas, are 
 1) able to select programs only based on your elibility - Elibility Filter, 
  2) able to compare and contrast programs at a glance - Compare Programs, 
  3) able to mark programs to view for later - Bookmark. 

The first two, as they are more of user value and significance to the user experience on the website, is more pronounced in the wireflow and interactive prototype. The bookmark function has not been designed into extensive detail with fleshed-out interactions
