# Assignment 07: Interactive Prototype

## Project Description
In hopes to improve the Health-e-Arizona-plus Portal that allows Arizona residents to apply and manage their benefits, I designed this interactive prototype to solve the current usability problems and match with user insights. This is the high-fidelity interaction design of the website where users are able to add eligibility filters to select programs based on their eligbility, compare and contrast programs at a glance, and bookmark programs to be viewed later. Users will be able to select the information they are most interested in through a time-efficient manner without having to jump between website and portals. The current prototype will focus on these three actions that are all located on the main landing page/dashboard of the website. 

### Purpose of Interactive Prototype

The purpose of this high-fidelity interactive prototype is to not only test the inituitiveness of the interaction, but to also test if improved graphics and UI components help support a better user experience and facilitate the user's understanding of the taskflow. With information and interactive components visualized in the optimal screensize, prototypes help me validate the flow and analyze the factors that influence the product's communication to the user. Will the graphical interface design distract the user or aid the user through their tasks? Are the interactions supported by this prototype inituitive, accessible, and findable to the user?

### Process of Interactive Prototype

After creating the basis of the interface designs, I created the high-fidelity wireflows with the Figma Autoflow plug-in for the two main tasks: eligibility filter and compare programs filter. After having the wireflow for these two tasks layered out, I went ahead and created the interactive prototype via Figma prototyping. I linked all the frames together and tested the prototype a few times on my own. When I found a certain problem in the interactions or a certain dead-end, I went back and edited/added interactions needed to make sure the user would not get lost in the flow. After this self-evaluation stage, I went on to conduct a cognitive walkthrough with my power user (participant from usability testing). After documenting the feedback I received from the user, I added necessary differentiation between pages and added screens to the flow where necessary to improve the clarify displayed by the interactive prototype. 

## List of Tasks Supported
The key tasks, validated by user research and extensive journey mapping of personas, are 
 1) able to select programs only based on your elibility - Elibility Filter, 
  2) able to compare and contrast programs at a glance - Compare Programs, 
  3) able to mark programs to view for later - Bookmark. 

The first two, as they are more of user value and significance to the user experience on the website, is more pronounced in the wireflow and interactive prototype. The bookmark function has not been designed into extensive detail with fleshed-out interactions

## Cognitive Walkthrough
### Process
The power user (participant from my usability testing) was recruited for the cognitive walkthrough. They interacted with the Figma prototype on my laptop. With each click, I asked two questions: 1) Is this the outcome they expected to achieve, 2) Did the user know how they could achieve the right outcome?. The user was asked to think-out-loud as they worked through the task: eligibility filter and compare programs. 

### Findings
 1. User report that some back buttons don't align with the previous pages they were on. This was a problem when the user clicked into viewing the specific program page, however when they clicked "back to home", they were returned to a clear dashboard without their previously activated eligiblity and compare programs filters. 
  2. User report that button names are much better than ones proposed before and give them quite a clear understanding of what the outcome would be. 
  3. User was able to achieve the MVP taskflow for both tasks (adding eligiblity filter and adding compare programs filter) without error. 
  4. User willfully interacted with the bookmark function. They recognized that this was a more minor feature compared to the other two filters. 

 ### Take Aways
  * I improved the interactive prototype by adding additional screens in the wireflow. For example, I made several copies of the same "programs page" where the "back to home" button was subsequently linked to different home page interfaces (empty, with eligibility filter on, with both eligibility and compare programs filters on). This way, where the users were located and what progress they have made towards their goal is clear in this prototype.
  * For the future, I would want to enrich the prototype by creating several program details pages and develop the bookmarks feature. 
  * I was glad that the button copy used the language that users are familiar with. It was relieving to see that this workflow was not cognitive taxing for the user even though it contained a lot of different interactive components that would help complete the same 3 tasks in many different routes.
