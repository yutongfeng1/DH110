## Assignment02: Usability Testing

### Introduction

For this pilot usability test, I will be examining the [Health-e-Arizona Plus Website](https://www.healthearizonaplus.gov/Login/Default) with a participant. This is a website where applicants can apply for coverage, benefit programs, and government services, such as nutrition benefits, medical coverage, and cash assistance. Applicants are allowed to create accounts to submit applications, view receipts, renew and manage their existing benefits. 

### Purpose of Usability Testing

The purpose of this usability testing is to improve the usability of the website by observing, documenting, and testing how users will navigate, understand, and complete important features and tasks. This test will identify problems in metrics of effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction. Through this usability testing, I hope feedback and insights from users will outline the flaws in the workflow, illuminate detailed problems not explored in the heuristic evaluation, and inform better design decisions. 

### Methodology
The usability testing is intended as a pilot test. The entire process took about 1 hour and 15 minutes. The testing was conducted via zoom where the participant turned on their web camera, shared their screen, and answered questionnaire questions orally. The participant was recruited as a close friend of the moderator. Steps of the usability testing entail the Introduction, Informed Consent Form, Background Questions, Pre-Test Questions, Usability Tasks, Post-Test Questions, and Demographic Questions. The participant was asked to think out loud to best reflect their action and concerns at the given contexts. 

The three tasks are designed in a linear order in reference to the timeline of an entire MVP work progress.
1. Screen for eligibility
2. Register account and begin application
3. Search for interview information

### Findings and Reflections

Overall, the pilot usability testing went better than expected. The participant was very communicative and cooperative. For this pilot test, I thought it was more important that I understand how users can on their own find their way back, so I withheld from stopping or offering directions to the participant even when they were stuck. Thankfully, this has given me a lot of insights about the usability of the website as I was able to ask the questions: “can users recover from their mistakes?” and “is the website intuitive?”. The pilot test highlighted usability problems overlooked by the larger-picture heuristic evaluation. For example, when I allowed the participant to travel down a more complex route to find the button “begin application” (instead of stopping them to tell them where the button is located), it not only illuminated how buttons and headers/labels are never apparent enough on the website, but also proved the severity of this problem as the user failed to recover from it. 

During the usability testing, I also noticed my shortcomings as a moderator and researcher. First, it was hard to phrase questions and responses on the spot: the ad hoc questions were not as neutral as I intended. My questions and guidance might have influenced my participants understanding of the task or confused them when I had trouble organizing a clear oral response. The second problem I encountered was that I did not know when to stop the participant and to give directions or explanations. I didn’t want the participant to think that they did anything wrong, so pulling them from their initial workflow was uneasy. But there were moments where I felt the need to stir the participant back to the right spot when constant trial-and-errors still could not recover them from an initial error.

The last insight I received from the usability testing was that my tasks should be concise and absent of unneeded distractions. I also should have checked-in with the participant before the study and updated the informed consent form to talk about the possibility of personal information disclosure. Though I checked-in with the participant at the beginning of the task and stopped the recording for the parts where the participants' personal information was in view, I felt that this warning could be voiced earlier in the study so participants feel more prepared. However, there is also another solution. Since it is important to see whether users get stuck while creating an application or signing up for account, I should created additional materials that protect the users’ privacy and ensures their safety. I can do this by preparing a persona profile where users can just fill-in the sensitive personal information required for the application with the given content. 

In conclusion, this pilot usability testing has not only provided me with an abundance of new findings and usability insights overlooked in the heuristic evaluation, but also highlighted the need to refine my materials and script to better prepare for usability testings in the future.
