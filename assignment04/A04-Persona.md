### FEATURE: ELIGIBILITY FILTER
#### Why Christina is using this feature
 Christina is currently in Los Angeles and spents her evenings to research her financial plans in Arizona. She feels that her income level is not enough to provide an uncomfortable life for herself while struggling to pay back student loans, thus she has been applying for financial benefits ever since graduating her Masters degree, specifically looking for medical and nutritional benefits. She is not tech savvy and remains only familiar with how benefit programs (in terms of program eligibility, application timeline, process, and required documents) work in California. Thus, she relies on information on the official Arizona government website to find out which benefits her income level is eligible for and what best suits her needs in this situation. On a very tight time frame, Christina wants to get to the information she needs as quick as possible.

 #### How Christina is using this feature  
After dinner, Christina turns on her personal laptop to research her eligibility for medical and nutritional benefits in Arizona. When she opens the website, there is a dashboard of all types of benefit programs offered. She chooses to view food benefits first, therefore presses the corresponding button. She lands on a new page. On this page, the website presents an overview chart of all food related benefits, with eligibility, application process, usual time of processing, and applicant portal URL. She notice that there is a button that says ‚Äúfilter for eligibility‚Äù. She loves the idea that the website can provide her information of only those benefits she does qualify for. She clicks on the button and a window pops up asking for her current income level. She fills in her income level and clicks submit. The page refreshes and a new chart is created with this filter. Christina is satisfied that she can efficiently learn about the programs that she will be eligible for; key informations are provided concisely without jargon. Noticing a ‚Äúsave‚Äù button at the top of the chart, Christina feels at ease that she can save this overview chart of all food benefits suitable for her needs as a pdf, picture, or permanent URL. This significantly narrows down her research to realistic, viable results.

### FEATURE: COMPARE/CONTRAST AND HEART TOOL
#### Why Luke is using this feature
As he just graduated from college, he is taking time between hanging out with friends and family to evaluate and decide his future location. With several job offers in different states in deck, Luke wants to know what are the financial advantages for him if he decides to move to Arizona and make on a job offer there. Luke is jumping from tabs to tabs, program to program, state to state, to compare and contrast his options: where can he create the best financial support to save up, invest, and to eventually start his own business? This is impossible, time-consuming work even for an Excel-expert like Luke. He is tired of reading all the texts and getting similar bits of information from everything. He wish there was a tool that could help him filter out notable differences from each. Since he is overloaded with information from different websites, he also wish he could mark benefit programs of his interest, where he can access quickly later without having to recall all the names and acronyms. He simply doesn't have the time and energy to spend on researching each program for each state.

 #### How Luke is using this feature  
Luke turns on his laptop after getting back home from a family dinner. Having made a few notes about the benefits in California and Washington on his excel, Luke is ready to research more about Arizona. He browses the Health-e-Arizona Plus portal for information about the existing financial benefits he could apply for online. Without having to sign or create any new accounts, he notices there is a bar that allows him to compare and contrast all existing programs. He drags two programs of interest: Cash Assistance and MediCare into the box, and see how the system highlights each‚Äôs positive and negatives in comparison to one another. The key points and noticeable differences are highlighted in the short buttle points. From the clear comparison, Luke understands that he is eligible for Cash Assistance and it is more suiting to his needs. Luke sees that there is a heart icon on the program card - he clicks it to mark this Cash Assistance program for later. Assured that he won‚Äôt lose record of his research today, Luke goes back to the main page to view and compare the nutrition benefit programs. He believes he can get his research done more efficiently tonight, picking out the best financial benefits offered by Arizona instead of feeling the dread from reading and endless searching.
