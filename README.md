# Benefiting Arizona
#### Yutong Feng | DH110 Fall 2021

## Design Challenge
During the COVID19 pandemic, many families have been struggling due to financial difficulties, plagued with medical bills and risk of unemployment. Through a brief navigation of the Arizona State Government websites, I found that help and resources are too hard to find. Online services and applications are already limited; when hidden in menu options and designed in hidden corners with unintuitive interactions, the design blocks families from the assistance that they need.

I am interested in creating a portal for families, where all government documents, applications, services, and benefits can be managed in one space. Through user research, competitive analysis, persona and journey mapping, I delivered an interactive prototype. This prototype was focused on three key actions to solve current usability problems and improve catastrophic interface problems on the landing page dashboard, where users can view at a glance all available benefit programs.

The three key tasks, validated by user insights, are:
 * to select programs only based on your elibility - Elibility Filter,
 * to compare and contrast programs at a glance - Compare Programs,
 * to mark programs to view for later - Bookmark.

Instead of experiencing the confusing workflow and having to jump between websites, users will be able to not only apply for these applications but to be informed of what each benefit entails on one website. Users will be able to select the information they are most interested in, view these information in a time-efficient and focused manner, and to be able to save and reaccess this information anytime.

## Problem Statement
HMW create a government portal for users to browse and apply for benefits in one place?

## UX Research
### Competitor Analysis
In this project, my design challenge is to improve the user experience for government portals. Through research, I find that there is an existing portal called [Health-e-Arizona Plus Portal](https://www.healthearizonaplus.gov/Login/Default). This is a website where applicants can apply for coverage, benefit programs, and government services, such as nutrition benefits, medical coverage, and cash assistance. Applicants are allowed to create accounts to submit applications, view receipts, renew and manage their existing benefits. In order to understand the current ecosystem, I decide it is essential that I heuristically evaluate this website and perform usability testings of key taskflows in order to have a grasp of what I have to do to improve the overall user experience.
